Pre- Requirements:

1) MATLAB ( I am currently working on Octave one, but yet to complete it)
2) A laryngeal vibration acquisition circuit ( A cascaded condensor microphone circuit will be suffice)

Technologies employed:

1) MFCC Algorithm
2) Vector Quantisation
3) Microsoft Speech API

How it works:

Take laryngeal vibrations and give it through an audio jack. Then run voicerecognition.m. Add vibrations, test vibrations.
